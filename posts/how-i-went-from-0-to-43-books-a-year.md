Reading has always been difficult for me. Oddly enough, I remember wanting to be a bookworm when I was younger but every time I picked up a book, I just didn't get it. All the books of my youth can be summarized as The Harry Potter Series. My change towards reading occurred anti-climatically in 2015, when I was 25 and discovered non-fiction. I obviously knew about non-fiction, but up until that point I only ever read fiction, and reading fiction to me seemed like just a slow way to consume content versus watching a movie.


I read my first non-fiction book, [The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368593.The_4_Hour_Workweek?ac=1&from_search=true), after being engrossed in the [Tim Ferris Podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/), and it changed the way I thought about books. This may seem obvious to you, but I never viewed books as a way to obtain actionable content before and it was truly enlightening.


After slowly getting into reading in 2017 I decided to make a goal of reading 12 books, with the idea of reading 1 book a month. As 2017 came to a close I ended up reading a total of [43 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/8201214).
Looking back over the last 3 years, I wanted to reflect on what lead to the fundamental shift in the way I read. Here are 5 key concepts that have shaped the way I think about reading.

# Realistically Prioritize Reading

There are only 24 hours in a day and that means if you want to read more, something else needs to get dropped. If you aren't honest with yourself and don't deliberately allocate time to reading, then there's no point in reading the rest of this article. Not having enough time to read simply means you're not prioritizing reading as something you care about.


I've personally replaced music with audiobooks for my commute, and reading instead of tv before bed.

# Stop Romanticizing Books

When I used to think of reading a book, I pictured someone cozily sitting by a fire, clutching a paperback classic. The reality is that everyone has a busy life and this romantic ideal deters rather then inspires reading. To me, reading isn't just a pastime; it's a means to knowledge and as such, it's important to use the right tool for the job. For books, this simply means format.

### Audiobooks (Audible)

This is how I personally consume 90% of the books I read. My most available time is when I'm doing an otherwise mundane task. Think groceries, driving, cleaning, or commuting. I'm also not a strong reader, and audiobooks allow me to consume books much more quickly.


**Bonus:** While it's not for everyone and varies by the book/reader, I highly recommend attempting to listen to audiobooks at 1.5–2.5x speed. It may seem incomprehensible at first, but your brain will quickly adjust and soon you will think 1x speed sounds like slow motion.

### Ebooks/Tablets (Kindle)

It's all about accessibility and convenience. My Kindle is in sync with my iPhone, so I can read a chapter on my phone and pickup from where I left off at home before bed. On top of that, you can carry and manage hundreds of books in a single compact device.

### Paperback Books

Some books just read better in paperback. These are usually books that have pictures or examples (ex. programming or textbooks). While I personally enjoy reading paperback books, it's about the content, not the format. For me, the advantages of Audio and Ebook outweigh the nostalgia of paper.

# Read what interests you

This could be Fantasy, Business, Biographies, Comic Books, Teen Fiction, or any of the other hundreds of genres. This may seem obvious, but I was making reading out to be something very specific when in reality it's what you want it to be.


The only way you will read more is if you enjoy it, and the only way you will enjoy it is if you're reading something that interests you. Get started anywhere and let your interests guide you.
[Naval Ravikant](https://medium.com/@naval) epitomizes this point in a single tweet.

# Cut your losses

Don't be a slave to the sunk cost fallacy. If the book sucks, is boring, or is not drawing your attention, put it down, or hell, skip ahead and see if it gets better. This isn't a textbook or something you have to read for a school project. It also doesn't mean you can't pick it up later; maybe you will have an appetite for it then.


I personally have about 2–4 books I'm actively reading at a time. Jumping back and forth depending on what I feel like reading in the moment.

# Focus on the underlying message

My retention is terrible, but this isn't a textbook you're being required to memorize or a class novel that you need to extract superficial meaning from. A good non-fiction usually focuses on one-to-two core concepts and iterates over them. While the details and examples help build the understanding, what's important is the underlying message.


This also makes certain types of books easy to put down. A lot of the self help books focus on one topic and provide a ton of very redundant examples. If you feel like you've extracted and internalized the core message, put it down and move on.

I personally feel that I've grown and learned so much from just the two years I've been reading. It's changed my perspective and has made me realize how little I know and how much I have to learn.
