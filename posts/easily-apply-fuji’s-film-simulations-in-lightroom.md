If you shoot Fuji, you most undoubtedly love Fuji’s Film Simulation. They really help capture the moment, and even if you still need post touchups, they offer a great starting point.


Unfortunately, if you shoot RAW and use Lightroom for post processing, you’ve seen what Lightroom thinks about Fuji’s Film Simulations. Lightroom sees this extra metadata and is like, ‘oh I’ll be helpful and just remove this. I’m sure the user will love that. Go me!’ Bad Lightroom… Bad. It’s almost like we took the photo with that simulation on purpose.


Fortunately, Fuji and Lightroom have made it easy to apply your Film Simulation in Lightroom.


## Steps
1. Select your Photo
2. Navigate to the Develop tab(if you’re not already there)
3. On the right, expand Camera Calibration
4. Select Profile: Adobe Standard and change it to the Fuji Film Simulation you want.
5. Rejoice in utter happiness
