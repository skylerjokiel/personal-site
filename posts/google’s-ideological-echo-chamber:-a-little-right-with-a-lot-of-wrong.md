The document [*Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber*](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf) recently leaked from the internals of Google and has caused an uproar in the media as well as a [public statement from Google’s CEO](https://www.blog.google/topics/diversity/note-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai/).
If you haven’t read the document there’s really no point of reading on. I believe best truth is the source so I implore you to please read the article yourself before letting others influence your opinion. You can read the full document [here](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf).


### My Assessment

The general premise of what was said is correct, or at least something I agree with. I believe that modern western society tries to force equality. I feel like it’s an overcompensation for the extreme oppression that has occurred so closely in our past and is still very present today. I agree that we don’t highlight the fact that physiologically every human on the planet is different and with these differences comes different strengths.


Where article goes wrong is the delivery. It builds up how we shouldn’t assume everyone is the same. Then it does the one thing it just said we shouldn’t by bucketed all women into an average. Maybe it’s me being the leftist that was mentioned, but the article went from outlining the taboo, but important, topic of equality to broken logic backed by inaccurate examples. Putting aside emotions, statistically you can’t take averages and start generically applying them to the few. **Correlation != Causation**


**Statement:** *“Women on average look for more work-life balance​ ​while men have a higher drive for status on average”*


**Conclusion:** *“Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) ​part time work​ ​though can keep more women in tech.”*


**Tl;dr:** Women, on average, value work life balance more, therefore men are more likely to be in top roles where there is less work life balance.


While the statement of average woman valuing work life balance more may be true, you simply can’t draw the following conclusion from that statement. Maybe women actually have more extremes? The average male could value work more then balance, compared to the average woman, but maybe the extreme women value work more then the extreme men do. Therefore there might actually be a larger pool of women available to fill those roles then men.


The entire document is based around these ambiguous averages followed by bold conclusions. Making generic statements like, we need to value the opinions of people whos opinions differ, followed by, we shouldn’t change the way our industry works just to make it more accommodating for a minority group. This statement is not only contradictive and wrong, it’s dangerous. We should always be trying to change and evolve our industry. Disruptions is what tech is built on.


Lets go back 50+ years when medicine was taking off, you are a woman, and you wanted to be a doctor. Best case you would get brushed off, worst case people would have called you crazy. Woman can’t be doctors… It requires long hours, with poor work life balance, women don’t have a steady enough hand, and (insert other sexiest/random reason). Fast forward to today and the health care industry, including doctors, is dominated by women.


### Fighting for diversity


There has been multiple studies done surrounding diversification in neighborhoods. The conclusion was always that the neighborhood will naturally trend towards an extreme equilibrium of either all black or all white. If there is a neighborhood of all white families, one white family leaves, and a black family enters, the likely hood of another black family moving in when the next person moves is much higher. This will eventually reach a tipping point where the neighborhood will become all black, or it will go back to all white. This was true until the City of Chicago took deliberate action to change how people bought homes which changed the natural equilibrium.*


The reason I use this as an example is because many people assume that the natural equilibrium will trend towards diversity when in fact the opposite is true. This is a scary reality that many industries before have faced and we continue to face in the tech industry. It’s continuously important that, as the minority, you force your position and continue to be heard. This is why I feel that conferences such as [Grace Hopper](https://ghc.anitaborg.org/) and organizations like [Women In Tech](http://www.womenintechnology.org/), are so important to the development of our industry.

Inclusion is so important, aside from the moral aspect, because people with differing experiences think differently. Having people from different backgrounds, cultures, race, religion, sex is so paramount to the evolution of an industry because of their perspectives. Saying this is how things currently work and everyone joining should conform to this or else you shouldn’t be here is completely backward to progression. It’s the opposite view of the industry I want to work for and the people I want to work with.
